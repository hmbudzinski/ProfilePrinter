# ProfilePrinter
## What: 
  The objective of this homework was to create a profile generator in node.js that when the user picks their favorite color and enters their github username, an axios call is made to github to pull that users information and print the requested info to a pdf.

## Why:
    this activity had us practice multiple node.js fuctions, axios, modules, and package json files. 

## How:
    I first created the axios call and prompt to get the user info. Once i was able to get that information pulled from the api and logging in the console, i then worked on getting it to print to an html and then convert to a pdf. It was very difficult going in and piecing together code once we finally got the started code, but i feel like i understand what was happening and that is the most important part. 

## Features:
    My page is able to take in the user input and pull their information from github and then print that info to a pdf.

## Difficulties:
    The hardest part of this assignment was getting the stars to work, i was unable to get that api working on that one but if i have time before our resubmit due date is up i'll try to get that working.
